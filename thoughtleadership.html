          The budgetary support for hydro energy under union budget 2025-26 is INR 50 crores. The allotment of funds to

  <h3><b>CURRENT LANDSCAPE OF EV MANUFACTURING - MOROCCO </b></h3>
  <h4><b>Morocco’s role in making Africa epicenter of global electric mobility production &amp; trade
    </b></h4>
  <h4 class="text-primary">MOROCCO POSITIONING ITSELF AS A SIGNIFICANT HUB FOR EV TRANSITION
  </h4>
  <div class="">
    <p class="text-justify">Morocco is increasingly positioning itself as a significant hub for strategic influence and
      innovation in the
      evolving landscape of EV transition. The country aims to further integrate itself into global value chains and
      bolster its standing as a leader in sustainable industrial development. However, the electric vehicle production
      in the country as of 2024 is in the infancy stage. <br>
       The country currently produces between 40,000 and 50,000
      electric vehicles per year, including the Fiat Topolino, Opel E-Rocks, and Citroën Ami mini-EVs. However,
      Morocco’s electric vehicle production capacity is expected to increase to around 100,000 units by 2025. By 2030,
      electric vehicles produced in Morocco are expected to account for up to 60 percent of all cars exported, according
      to the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
    </p>
    <h5><b>Investments in Morocco for the EV &amp; its Value Chain </b></h5>
    <p class="text-justify">Morocco is emerging as a key hub for Chinese companies eager to lead the charge in
      e-mobility. Through strategic
      partnerships, the country is laying the groundwork for a robust electric vehicle industry and supply chain, paving
      the way for a sustainable, tech-driven automotive future. With $10.5 billion in investments backing these
      agreements, Morocco is accelerating toward a greener, smarter future on the road.</p>

    <p class="text-justify">Morocco's strategic location at the crossroads of Europe, Africa, and the United States
      uniquely positions it to
      capitalize on opportunities in the electric vehicle (EV) industry. Nestled between the EU and Africa, the country
      can efficiently access both markets. The short 14-kilometer distance between Morocco and Europe, via the Strait of
      Gibraltar, provides seamless supply chain logistics, advanced technologies, research, and a ready consumer base.
      Meanwhile, its connection to Africa presents exciting opportunities for market expansion in a continent with
      growing demand for electric vehicles. <br> The port of Tanger Med, Africa's largest port, located 45 km northeast of
      Tangier and opposite Spain, enhances Morocco's strategic advantage, serving as a vital trade gateway. This boosts
      Morocco’s role as a prime investment destination and a key hub for the production, innovation, and export of EVs
      and related technologies.</p>
    <p>
      Morocco's venture into electro-mobility is not a solo journey but one built on strong strategic partnerships with
      leading global industry players, including China. These collaborations aim to develop a solid foundation for the
      electric automotive industry and its supply chain, driving a future that is both sustainable and technologically
      advanced. A landmark achievement in this regard is the agreement to establish Africa's first Gigafactory by Gotion
      High-Tech Co., Ltd. This investment, signed on June 6, 2024, marks a significant milestone in Morocco's role in
      shaping the future of the EV industry.</p>
