          The budgetary support for on grid solar energy under union budget 2025-26 is INR 1500 crores. This is 85% less
          than that announced in the budget of 2024-25. Revised allocation for 2024-25 is significantly low which may be

          The budgetary support for wind energy under union budget 2025-26 is INR 500 crores. This is 37.5% less than
          that announced in the budget of 2024-25. GoI is giving impetus on increasing standalone onshore and offshore
          wind projects as well as hybrid projects. Does this decline in the support indicates a shift in the focus of
          government?
          The budgetary support for hydro energy under union budget 2025-26 is INR 50 crores. The allotment of funds to
          hydro energy have seen significant rise of 271% from 2023-24 to union budget of 2024-25 and 2025-26. This
          increase may be due to increase focus on developing pumped hydro storage projects in the country for

          The increase in budgetary support for IREDA to ₹34,974.99 crore in FY 2025-26 signals a stronger commitment by
          the government to accelerate the growth of renewable energy in India. This boost reflects a focus on expanding
          renewable energy capacity, meeting climate targets, and enhancing financial support for clean energy projects.
          The funds are likely to strengthen IREDA’s role in financing innovation, and energy storage solutions, thus
          contributing to India’s transition towards a sustainable energy future.
          While decrease in the allocations for SECI may represent the trend of delay in progress of bids and
          realization and commission of the renewable projects which may be due to supply chain or land availability
          issues.
